			<h2> Intro </h2>
			<p> As computer science students (situated in North America), we are taught to value particular 
				definitions of “computer science” and “computer scientist.” Issues of ethics, social justice,
				and the environment are typically not part of these definitions. Rather, computer science is 
				often presented as immaterial and abstract (mathematical). When the materiality of computer 
				science is addressed (e.g. in software engineering), larger webs of labour and extraction remain hidden.
				The purpose of this website is to familiarize computer science students with concepts that they 
				can use to think critically about computer science and their own experiences in computer science.  </p>
			<br>
			<h2> Questions to Consider </h2>
			<p> The following are some questions students might consider as they work:
				<ul>
  					<li>Who is this for?</li>
  					<li>Is this something the users/target audience actually want? Are users involved in 
						the design process? Have you gotten user feedback?</li>
  					<li>What processes of extraction are taking place to create it?</li>
				</ul>
