			<h2> About </h2>
			<p>The purpose of this website is to introduce Computer Science students to important theoretical concepts, social justice issues, and best practices
				related to computer science. In doing so, I hope that this website will act as a starting point for students to think critically
				about computer science.</p>
			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>This website was created by Hana Darling-Wolf (me!), an undergraduate student in Computer Science and Gender, Sexuality, Feminist, and Social Justice Studies at McGill University.
      My research focuses on computer science identities and computer science education.</p>
			<p>Although I am by no means an expert on these topics, I hope to make what knowledge I have accessible to other Computer Science students.
			</p>
