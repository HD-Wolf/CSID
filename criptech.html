			<h2> Crip Technoscience </h2>
			<p>In order to understand crip technoscience, it is first important to make a distinction between two definitions of disability:
				<ul>
				       <li><b>the medical model:</b> This is the mainstream model of disability. It presents disability itself as a problem which causes 
					  harm to disabled people and those around them. It suggests that disabled people must be “fixed” in order to gain equality in society.
					  This view works to exclude disabled people by presenting them as incapable of being fully participatory members of society.
				       </li>
				       <li><b>the social model:</b> This model presents the way disabled people are treated in society as the main source of harm to disabled
					  people. It is through the construction of societal barriers to inclusion (ableism) that disabled people are harmed, rather than
					  disability itself. This is the model prefered by (the overwhelming majority of) disabled people.
				      </li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p><b>Crip technoscience</b> is a field of critical scholarship, practice, and activism which adopts the social model of disability, 
				presenting technology as a tool for political action and resistance to pressures to fix, cure, or eliminate disability. However, it also 
				acknowledges the “non-innocence” of technology, much of which holds ties to the military-industrial complex, and which is imbricated in 
				processes of colonialism, ecological destruction, and discrimination.
			</p>
			<p>In their Crip Technoscience Manifesto, Aimi Hamraie and Kelly Fritsch outline four commitments of crip technoscience:
				<ul>
					<li><b>“Crip technoscience centers the work of disabled people as knowers and makers.”</b> The design work that disabled 
					  people do in their everyday lives to create access is rarely recognized as design. The lived experience of disabled people 
					  gives them specific expertise and knowledge in technoscientific intervention.</li>
					<li><b>“Crip technoscience is committed to access as friction.”</b> Creating access 
					  is an act of non-compliance and protest against an inaccessible environment and pressures to assimilate to an ableist society. </li>
					<li><b>“Crip technoscience is committed to interdependence as political technology.”</b> Crip technoscience emphasizes the value 
					  of kinship and connection while also acknowledging the entanglement of disability and technology with structures of power.</li>
					<li><b>“Crip technoscience is committed to disability justice.”</b> The critiques and practices of crip technoscience aligned 
					  with those of the disability justice movement, including the rejection of presentations of disabled people as passive consumers 
					  and objects of assimilationist technology.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>This contrasts with disability technoscience, which operates on the medical model of disability, 
			treating technology as a “solution” to disability, and disabled people not as designers or experts, 
			but as passive recipients of technological assistance. <b><span style="background-color: #ffe0cc">This view is overwhelmingly clear in Hackathons, 
			where disability is commonly presented as a problem in need of a solution. In a hackathon, this often 
			promotes the creation of technology “for” and not “with” or “by” disabled people.</span></b> This view fails to 
			acknowledge disabled people as creators, hackers, designers, and technological experts and reinforces ableist norms.
