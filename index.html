			<h2> Intro </h2>
			<p> As computer science students (situated in North America), we are taught to value particular 
				definitions of “computer science” and “computer scientist.” Issues of ethics, social justice,
				and the environment are typically not part of these definitions. Rather, computer science is 
				often presented as immaterial and abstract (mathematical). When the materiality of computer 
				science is addressed (e.g. in software engineering), larger webs of labour and extraction remain hidden.
				The purpose of this website is to familiarize computer science students with concepts that they 
				can use to think critically about computer science and their own experiences in computer science.  </p>
			<br>
			<p> See the <a href="grid.html">"Grid"</a> tab for an overview of the terms and concepts.
				Below is a list of questions for students to consider as they start to think critically about their own work
				and the tech they use and interact with. </p>
			<br>
			<h2> Questions to Consider </h2>
			<p> The following are some questions students might consider as they work:
				<ul>
  					<li>Who is this for?</li>
  					<li>Is this something the users/target audience actually want? Are users involved in 
						the design process? Have you gotten user feedback?</li>
  					<li>What processes of extraction are taking place to create it?</li>
					<li>Are you coding?
						<ul>
							<li> Are you writing everything yourself?</li>
							<li> Are you clearly documenting your code?</li>
							<li> How much space is it using? How fast does it run? Can you minimize these?</li>
							<li> Are you using someone else’s code? Do you understand how it works? Have you cited them?</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		
			<p>
				This list of questions is by no means inclusive, and should be used as a starting place for raising your own questions.
				Ethics should never be a checklist [see the following for a satyrical paper that makes clear why: 
				<a href=""> A Mulching Proposal by Os Keyes, Jevan Hutson, and Meridith Durbin </a>].
