			<h2>Problems with the Pipeline Metaphor</h2>
			<p>The pipeline metaphor, or the metaphor of the “leaky pipeline” is commonly used in research on women
        in computer science. It suggests that at each stage in the computer science education and career path, 
        the number of women decreases as they “leak” from the career pipeline. <span style="background-color: #ffe0cc"><b>This quantitative focus on the 
        lack of women in computer science is problematic because it sets men as the standard of measurement, 
        assumes that women’s lack of participation in STEM fields is a “problem”</b> (i.e. that a normative computer
        science career is an inherently good goal people should strive for), <b>and assumes a linear career progression.</b></span>
        This erases the possibility that women decided to use their computational skills in other areas, or that they 
        did not want to support Big Tech.
			</p>
			<p>Although quantifying the “woman problem” as a numerical lack of women provides a clear solution (increasing
        the number of women in computer science), it fails to challenge heteronormative gender binaries and encourages
        a focus on the qualities women “lack” in comparison to men, rather than issues with gender binaries or within 
        computer science (e.g. providing special training for women’s supposed “lack” of confidence and motivation in 
        comparison to men, without questioning the desirability and implications of these values). Moreover, solutions 
        which focus solely on increasing the number of women in computing typically fail, because they do not address 
        the larger structures which reflect and reinforce the norms and values of upper-class White men.
			</p>
			<p>Furthermore, as researcher Sara Vogel has pointed out, advocacy work done by organizations like Code.org which 
        promote “equity” and “access” is undermined by their reification of neoliberal values and gendered norms in computing.
			</p>
			<p>In order to imagine a feminist future involving tech, it is necessary to question computer science as a practice, 
        thought process, and discipline, and the structures of power embedded at each level.
