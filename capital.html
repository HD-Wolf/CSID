			<h2> Capital </h2>
			<p> <b>“Cultural capital” refers to the material and immaterial resources, 
			skills, and dispositions which an individual or group can draw on for privilege, 
			acceptance, and success in a particular environment.</b></p>
			<p> Cultural capital is acquired by virtue of belonging to a particular social class. 
			Particular forms of cultural capital are valued over others, and increased cultural 
			capital allows for greater social mobility. </p>
			<p> Pierre Bourdieu famously introduced this concept in the context of university education,
			where he examined how students exchange the mannerisms, knowledge, and skills they acquire 
			throughout their previous education and early learning for belonging and success in university.</p>
			<p><span style="background-color: #ffe0cc"> In the context of <b>computer science education</b>, capital can take the 
			form of access to highschool computer science classes, clubs, or workshops, early access to a computer,
			family science capital (having family members who do computer science), or acceptance in certain related 
			social spaces (e.g. gaming communities, online forums, etc.). <b>Access to this capital is dependent not only 
			on social class, but on other identity factors like gender, race, and ability.</b></span> Although access 
			to computer science capital before university does not pre-determine 
			one’s success in the field, it works to privilege certain types of students whose computer
			science abilities (and comfort with CS) are often framed as a “natural disposition” (see <a href="habitus.html">Habitus</a>).</p>
